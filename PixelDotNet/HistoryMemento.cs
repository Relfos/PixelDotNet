    /// A HistoryMemento is generally used to save part of the state of the Document
    /// so that an action that is yet to be performed can be undone at a later time.
    /// For example, if you are going to paint in a certain region, you first create a
    /// HistoryMemento that saves the contents of the area you are painting to. Then you
    /// paint. Then you push the history action on to the history stack.
    /// 
    /// Using the HistoryMementoData class you can serialize your data to disk so that it
    /// doesn't fester in memory. There are important rules to follow here though:
    /// 1. Don't hold a reference to a Layer. Store a reference to the DocumentWorkspace and
    ///    the layer's index instead, and access it via Workspace.Document.Layers[index].
    /// 2. The exception to #1 is if you are deleting a layer. But you should use
    ///    DeleteLayerHistoryMemento for that. If you need to delete a layer as part of a
    ///    compound action, use CompoundHistoryMemento in conjunction with 
    ///    DeleteLayerHistoryMemento.
    /// 3. To generalize, avoid serializing something unless you're replacing or deleting it.
    ///    (and by 'serializing' I mean 'putting it in your HistoryMementoData class')
    ///    It is better to hold a 'navigation reference' as opposed to a real reference.
    ///    An example of a 'navigation reference' is listed in #1, where we don't store a ref
    ///    to the layer itself but we store the information needed to navigate to it.
    ///    The reasoning for this is made clear if you consider the following case. Assume you
    ///    are holding on to a layer reference ("private Layer theLayer;"). Next, assume that
    ///    the layer is deleted. Then the deletion is undone. The new layer in memory is not
    ///    the layer you have a reference to even though they hold the same data. Changes made
    ///    to one do not show up in the other one. Put another way, history actions should
    ///    store large objects and their locations "by value," and not "by reference."
