## Description

**Pixel.NET** started as a fork of Paint.NET, based on the [latest version](https://github.com/rivy/OpenPDN) that had an open source license. 

All effects and other functions that don't make sense for pixel art like scanning / printing were stripped out, along with build tools, updaters, ink support and shell extension.

It also has [PSDPlugin](https://github.com/PsdPlugin/PsdPlugin) builtin.
